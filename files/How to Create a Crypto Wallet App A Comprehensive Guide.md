## Understanding Cryptocurrency Wallets  

A **cryptocurrency wallet** is a digital tool that allows users to store, send, and receive digital assets. Unlike traditional wallets, crypto wallets donâ€™t physically hold coins. Instead, they manage **public and private keys** that interact with blockchain networks.  

### Key Concepts

|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Public Key**| Acts as a wallet address for receiving funds. Shared freely with others.    |
| **Private Key**| A secret code granting access to funds. Must be kept secure at all times.   |

### Types of Crypto Wallets  

Crypto wallets fall into two categories: **hot wallets** (online) and **cold wallets** (offline). Hereâ€™s a breakdown:
