## Transaction Mechanics Explained

Understanding how crypto transfers work is essential for smooth operations. Each transaction involves:

1. **Public Address**: A unique identifier (e.g., 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa) used to receive funds
2. **Private Key**: A secret code proving ownership of the associated public address
3. **Transaction Fee**: Network charges based on blockchain congestion
4. **Confirmation Time**: Varies from seconds (Solana) to minutes (Bitcoin)

**Common Transaction Issues**:
- Sending to the wrong network (e.g., ERC-20 vs. BEP-20)
- Incorrect address entry (always double-check)
- Insufficient transaction fees causing delays
