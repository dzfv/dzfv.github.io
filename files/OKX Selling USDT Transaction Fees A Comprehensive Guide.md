## Understanding OKX‚Äôs USDT Transaction Fee Structure

| Trading Tier | Monthly Trading Volume (USDT) | Maker Fee | Taker Fee |  
|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|  
| Tier 1       | < 50,000                     | 0.10%     | 0.10%     |  
| Tier 2       | 50,000‚Äì500,000               | 0.08%     | 0.10%     |  
| Tier 3       | 500,000‚Äì5,000,000            | 0.06%     | 0.08%     |  
| Tier 4       | > 5,000,000                  | 0.04%     | 0.06%     |  

*Note: Maker fees apply to limit orders that add liquidity; taker fees apply to market orders that remove liquidity.*
