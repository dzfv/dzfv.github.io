# TRON Network Expands Stablecoin Integration with Bridge, Boosting Global Payment Infrastructure  

## Strategic Partnership Enhances Developer Capabilities in Emerging Markets  

**Geneva, Switzerland, May 23, 2025** ‚Äì The TRON network, a leading blockchain platform focused on decentralized internet infrastructure, has announced an expanded integration with Bridge, a Stripe company specializing in stablecoin orchestration. This collaboration solidifies TRON‚Äôs position as a top settlement layer for stablecoins, driven by its scalability, low transaction costs, and robust network performance.  

TRON now hosts nearly one-third of the global stablecoin supply, including over $77 billion in USDT ‚Äì more than half of its total circulation. With daily USDT transfers averaging $20 billion and over 2.5 million daily active users, the network continues to dominate in active engagement and transaction volume.  

Bridge, serving hundreds of developers in emerging markets, leverages TRON‚Äôs infrastructure to enable seamless access to US dollars and treasury-backed stablecoins. The enhanced cross-border API integration allows developers to scale payment applications and DeFi projects with unprecedented flexibility.  

> ‚ÄúStrengthening our integration with Bridge isn‚Äôt just an upgrade ‚Äì it‚Äôs a gateway for innovation,‚Äù said Sam Elfarra, Community Spokesperson for TRON DAO. ‚ÄúDevelopers can now build without limits, creating solutions that bridge traditional finance and blockchain.‚Äù  

### Key Enhancements for Stablecoin Transactions  

The expanded partnership introduces four critical features designed to streamline stablecoin payments on TRON:  

1. **End-to-End USDT.trx Support Across Payment Routes**  
   Bridge now supports full interoperability for USDT.trx across all payment routes, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions for businesses and users.  

2. **Fiat On/Off-Ramps for USDT.trx**  
   Developers can integrate direct fiat conversions for USDT.trx, simplifying the transition between crypto and traditional financial systems.  

3. **Memoless Wallet Support**  
   TRON transactions no longer require memos, improving wallet compatibility and user onboarding experiences.  

4. **Native Infrastructure for Deposits and Withdrawals**  
   TRON becomes the first blockchain to integrate with Bridge‚Äôs proprietary deposit and withdrawal infrastructure, offering unlimited deposit addresses and enhanced transaction speed.  

These updates position TRON and Bridge as critical partners for developers building financial applications in emerging markets. Improved cross-chain transfers, native fiat integration, and streamlined wallet infrastructure empower developers to create faster, more efficient payment solutions.  

## TRON Network: A Leader in Stablecoin Adoption  

Since its MainNet launch in 2018, TRON has grown into one of the most influential blockchain networks globally. Key statistics include:  

| Metric                     | Value              |
