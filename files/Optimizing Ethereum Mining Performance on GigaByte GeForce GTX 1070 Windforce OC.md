# Optimizing Ethereum Mining Performance on GigaByte GeForce GTX 1070 Windforce OC  

## Understanding the Mining Setup  

This article explores optimization strategies for Ethereum mining using six GigaByte GeForce GTX 1070 Windforce OC graphics cards. The user achieved 31 MH/s per GPU (total 183-185 MH/s at 768W power draw) but seeks improved efficiency through overclocking adjustments and alternative mining strategies.  

## Overclocking Fundamentals for Ethereum Mining  

Ethereum mining performance heavily depends on memory clock optimization. The current configuration shows:  

- **Core Clock**: 1657/1847 MHz (Current: 1671 MHz)  
- **Mem Clock**: 9500 MHz (Current: 9104 MHz)  
- **TDP**: -40% (768W total power consumption)  
- **Fans**: 65%  

While 9500 MHz memory clock represents maximum achievable levels for many GTX 1070 models, individual card variance affects stability. Manufacturing differences in memory chips (e.g., Samsung vs. Micron) create performance inconsistencies across identical GPU models.  

### Key Optimization Considerations  
1. **Voltage Tuning**: Reducing voltage while maintaining hashrate improves energy efficiency  
2. **TDP Adjustment**: Lowering TDP beyond -40% risks performance degradation  
3. **Temperature Management**: 65% fan speed balances noise and thermal control

## Power Efficiency Strategies  

With electricity costs at $0.43/kWh, power efficiency becomes critical. Current power draw (768W for 6 cards) yields:  

| Configuration | Power Draw | Hashrate | Efficiency |  
|---------------|------------|----------|------------|  
| Current Setup | 768W       | 186 MH/s | 4.13 W/MH  |  
| Potential Target | 650W    | 174 MH/s | 3.74 W/MH  |  

Reducing TDP to 60% maintained stability while improving efficiency. Further experimentation at 55% TDP caused instability, suggesting current settings represent optimal balance.  

### Power Optimization FAQ  
**Q: How can I reduce power consumption without losing hashrate?**  
A: Gradually lower core voltage while monitoring hashrate. Use tools like MSI Afterburner to fine-tune voltage-frequency curves.  

**Q: What's the ideal MH/s to watt ratio for GTX 1070 mining?**  
A: Target 4.0 W/MH or lower. Cards with Samsung memory chips typically achieve better efficiency.  

**Q: Should I consider undervolting?**  
A: Yes - reducing voltage by 10-15% while maintaining base clock speeds often improves stability.

## Profitability Analysis and Alternative Mining Options  

While Ethereum mining remains viable, GTX 1070 cards show better performance with other algorithms:  

| Algorithm Type | Recommended Coins         | Potential Profitability |  
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|  
| Skein-Based    | LBRY (DCR), Skeincoin       | 15-25% higher ROI       |  
| Groestl-Based  | Groestlcoin (GRS)          | 20-30% higher efficiency|  
| Equihash       | Zcash (ZEC), Hush (HUSH)   | Variable profitability  |  

### Mining Strategy FAQ  
**Q: Should I switch from Ethereum to alternative coins?**  
A: If prioritizing immediate profitability, yes. Skein/Groestl-based coins offer 15-30% better returns for GTX 1070 hardware.  

**Q: Is dual mining worth considering?**  
A: Dual mining Ethereum with Decred or Sia can increase total revenue by 5-10% without significant overhead.  

**Q: How do I track coin profitability?**  
A: Use platforms like WhatToMine or NiceHash profitability calculator. Prioritize coins with high MH/s-to-Watt ratios.

## Hardware-Specific Optimization  

The GigaByte GeForce GTX 1070 Windforce OC demonstrates unique thermal characteristics:  

- **Memory Cooling**: Windforce triple-fan design maintains memory temperatures 5-8Â°C below reference models  
- **VRM Efficiency**: Custom power design supports sustained overclocks  
- **Power Connector**: 8+6 pin configuration handles increased power demands  

### Hardware FAQ  
**Q: Can all GTX 1070 models reach 32 MH/s?**  
A: No. Only cards with Samsung memory chips typically achieve 32-34 MH/s. Windforce OC models generally max at 30-31 MH/s.  

**Q: What power supply do I need for 6-card rig?**  
A: Minimum 850W 80+ Gold PSU for stable operation. Consider 1000W units for headroom during overclocking.  

**Q: Why does hashrate fluctuate at extreme TDP settings?**  
A: Aggressive power limits can cause voltage instability, triggering dynamic clock adjustments.  

## Conclusion and Next Steps  

The current configuration represents a balanced optimization point for Ethereum mining with GTX 1070 hardware. For users in high-cost energy regions ($0.43/kWh):  

1. Consider transitioning to Skein/Groestl-based mining pools  
2. Maintain current Ethereum configuration for diversification  
3. Monitor emerging algorithms where Pascal architecture maintains advantage  

For those prioritizing hardware longevity:  
- Maintain core clocks below 1900 MHz  
- Keep memory clocks under 9500 MHz  
- Monitor VRAM temperatures above 85Â°C
