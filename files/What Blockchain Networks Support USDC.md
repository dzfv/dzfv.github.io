## Technical Architecture: Understanding ERC-20

As an Ethereum-based token, USDC follows the **ERC-20 protocol** - a technical standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. This protocol ensures:

- Uniform programming rules for token interactions
- Compatibility with Ethereum wallets and DApps
- Predictable transaction mechanics

The ERC-20 framework enables seamless integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and automated market makers (AMMs), making USDC a cornerstone for liquidity pools and yield farming strategies.

## Governance and Backing

USDC is issued by the **Centre Consortium**, a partnership between:
- **Circle** (majority-owned by Circle Internet Financial)
- **Coinbase** (leading cryptocurrency exchange)

This institutional backing provides:
- Regular third-party audits
- Full reserve backing by USD deposits
- Regulatory compliance frameworks

The 1:1 USD peg is maintained through strict reserve management, with monthly attestation reports published for transparency.

## Transaction Efficiency

USDC transaction speeds vary by blockchain:
- **Ethereum**: 15-30 seconds (network congestion-dependent)
- **Solana**: <1 second finality
- **Avalanche**: ~2 seconds
- **TRON**: ~3 seconds

Wallet options include:
- Mobile apps (Trust Wallet, MetaMask Mobile)
- Hardware wallets (Ledger, Trezor)
- Exchange-based storage
