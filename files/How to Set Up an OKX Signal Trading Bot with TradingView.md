## Integration Examples

### MACD Crossover Strategy (Pine Scriptâ„¢)
```pinescript
//@version=5
indicator('MACD Signal Bot Example', overlay=true)

[macdLine, signalLine, _] = ta.macd(close, 12, 26, 9)
goldenCross = ta.crossover(macdLine, signalLine)
deathCross = ta.crossunder(macdLine, signalLine)

alertcondition(goldenCross, "MACD Golden Cross", "ENTER_LONG")
alertcondition(deathCross, "MACD Death Cross", "EXIT_LONG")
```

### Python Webhook Implementation
```python
import requests
import datetime
import json

signal_data = {
    "action": "ENTER_LONG",
    "instrument": "BTC-USDT-SWAP",
    "signalToken": "your_token",
    "timestamp": datetime.datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
    "investmentType": "percentage_balance",
    "amount": "10"
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://bit.ly/okx-bonusalgo/signal/trigger",
    data=json.dumps(signal_data)
)
```

## Best Practices for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with 5-10% of your total capital
2. **Monitor Performance**: Review bot statistics weekly
3. **Risk Management**: Never exceed 2% risk per trade
4. **Strategy Validation**: Backtest for at least 3 months of historical data
5. **Continuous Optimization**: Adjust parameters based on market conditions
