## FAQs  

### 1. **Why is Arbitrumâ€™s short-term outlook bearish?**  
Technical indicators (e.g., 71% bearish signals) and key support levels being tested suggest downward pressure. The coinâ€™s underperformance against BTC and ETH further reinforces this trend.  

### 2. **Could Arbitrum rebound above $0.32?**  
A breakout above $0.319066 resistance could signal bullish momentum. However, sustained trading below this level likely precedes further declines.  

### 3. **What risks should investors monitor?**  
Market-wide volatility, regulatory updates, and Ethereum network performance (as Arbitrum is a layer-2 solution) are critical risks.  

### 4. **How reliable is technical analysis for ARB?**  
While technical indicators provide valuable insights, crypto markets are highly unpredictable. Combining on-chain data and macro trends improves accuracy.  

### 5. **Is Arbitrum a good long-term investment?**  
Layer-2 solutions play a vital role in Ethereumâ€™s scalability, but short-term volatility and competition from other protocols pose challenges.
