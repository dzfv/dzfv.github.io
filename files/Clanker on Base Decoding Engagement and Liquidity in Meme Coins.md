Posted at 02:58 UTC on June 30, 2025, the tweet reads: *"engagement is the product, liquidity the by-product."* Paired with a funky robotic Pepe the Frog image, this short message has sparked curiosity about what it means for the world of meme coins. As a former editor-in-chief of CoinDesk and now a writer at [meme-insider.com](https://meme-insider.com), Iâ€™m here to break it down for you in a way thatâ€™s easy to digestâ€”while sprinkling in some SEO magic to help you find this gem later!

## What Does "Engagement is the Product" Mean?

Letâ€™s start with the core idea: **engagement**. In the crypto world, especially with meme coins, engagement refers to how much people interact with a tokenâ€”think likes, retweets, comments, and even hype on platforms like X or Discord. Clanker seems to suggest that this buzz _is_ the main product. Unlike traditional investments where the value comes from utility or profit, meme coins like Dogecoin or Shiba Inu often thrive on community excitement.

Research from [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) shows that high engagement can predict short-term price spikes, especially for alt-coins, because it reflects sentiment and interest.

### Key Insights on Engagement:
1. **Social Proof**: Viral moments, such as a meme coin getting a shoutout from a big influencer, can skyrocket engagement and priceâ€”sometimes wildly.
2. **Community-Driven Value**: Meme coins derive their worth from collective attention rather than technical innovation.
3. **Short-Term Focus**: Engagement often correlates with rapid price movements, making it a critical metric for traders.

Clankerâ€™s post hints that this social energy is what creators and traders should focus on, rather than just the tokenâ€™s tech specs. Itâ€™s all about building a community thatâ€™s passionate enough to keep the coin alive.

## Liquidity as the By-Product: Whatâ€™s That About?

Now, letâ€™s talk about **liquidity**â€”the ease with which a coin can be bought or sold without causing huge price swings. According to [b2broker.com](https://b2broker.com), high liquidity means a stable market with lots of buyers and sellers, which is a dream for traders. Clankerâ€™s take is fascinating: liquidity isnâ€™t the goal but a natural outcome of strong engagement.

When people are hyped about a meme coin, more folks jump in to trade, increasing the marketâ€™s liquidity.

### The Engagement-Liquidity Connection:
| **Engagement Factor**       | **Liquidity Impact**                     |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| High social media activity  | Increased buyer/seller participation     |
| Viral marketing campaigns   | Sudden spikes in trading volume          |
| Sustained community interest| Long-term market stability               |

Think of it like a party: if everyoneâ€™s talking about the event (engagement), more people show up (liquidity). But if the buzz dies down, the party empties out fast, leaving the coin hard to trade. This ties into the idea that meme coins live or die by their communityâ€™s attention, as noted in [investopedia.com](https://www.investopedia.com) articles about meme coin dynamics.

## Clankerâ€™s Philosophy in Action

Diving deeper into the thread, clankeronbase drops more wisdom. In a follow-up post, they quip, *"if you need certainty, go buy T bills, if you need dignity, touch grass, if you want a good time, clanker on base."* This playful tone suggests Clanker is all about the wild, unpredictable fun of meme coins, especially on the **Base network** (a layer-2 blockchain solution). Another post mentions, *"does it pump? sometimes. often violently. occasionally inversely,"* highlighting the rollercoaster nature of these tokensâ€”driven, of course, by engagement levels.

The robotic Pepe image ties it all together, symbolizing a blend of meme culture and blockchain tech. Itâ€™s a nod to how meme coins often start as jokes but evolve into serious trading assets when the community rallies behind them.

## Why This Matters for Blockchain Practitioners

If youâ€™re a blockchain developer or trader, Clankerâ€™s insight is a goldmine. Building a meme coin? Focus on creating engaging content and fostering a communityâ€”think AMAs, memes, or even NFT drops. Tools like those mentioned on [ninjapromo.io](https://ninjapromo.io) can help optimize your crypto SEO to attract the right audience. And remember: liquidity will follow if the engagement is strong.

### Strategies for Success:
- **Leverage Social Platforms**: Use Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok to build hype.
- **Create Shareable Content**: Memes, videos, and interactive polls drive engagement.
- **Host Community Events**: AMAs, live streams, and airdrops keep audiences invested.

This approach can turn a quirky token into a market player, as seen with past successes like Dogecoin.
