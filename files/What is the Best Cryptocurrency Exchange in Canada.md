Security remains paramount in cryptocurrency trading. Reputable exchanges implement multiple layers of protection, including:

- **Two-factor authentication (2FA)** via apps like Google Authenticator
- Cold storage solutions for 90%+ of user funds

2. **Withdrawal fees**: Network-dependent charges for crypto transfers
