## Core Features of KISHU Inu  

### 1. Community-Driven Governance  
KISHU operates as a **decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)**, where token holders vote on protocol changes and treasury allocations. This model ensures collective decision-making, fostering a sense of ownership among participants.  

### 2. Liquidity Incentive Mechanism  
A 5% transaction tax is automatically distributed to liquidity pools, creating **self-sustaining liquidity**. This mechanism reduces price volatility and rewards long-term holders through dynamic yield generation.  

### 3. Deflationary Supply Model  
With a total supply of 1 quadrillion tokens and 50% burned at launch, KISHU employs a deflationary strategy. Continuous burn functions embedded in smart contracts gradually reduce circulating supply, potentially driving value appreciation.  

### 4. Ethereum Blockchain Integration  
Built on **Ethereum's Layer 1**, KISHU benefits from the network's robust security and extensive DeFi ecosystem. Compatibility with ERC-20 standards enables seamless integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and wallet services.
