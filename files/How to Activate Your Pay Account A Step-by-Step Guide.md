## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: Why does Pay require a separate passkey?**  
A: Pay operates as a smart contract wallet requiring transaction-specific signatures. This architecture maintains strict separation between exchange funds and Pay wallet balances.  

**Q: Can I use my existing exchange passkey?**  
A: No. The Pay passkey system is completely independent from your exchange authentication credentials to prevent cross-system vulnerabilities.  

**Q: What happens if I lose my passkey?**  
A: Utilize the ZK Email recovery system to regain access without compromising security.

## Passkey Creation Explained  

The activation process automatically generates:  
- **Hardware-backed key pair** stored in secure device enclaves  
- **Biometric authentication templates** for seamless access  
- **Backup recovery protocols** using zero-knowledge cryptography  

> **Critical Security Advice**: Avoid third-party passkey managers. Mobile operating systems (iOS Keychain/Android Keystore) provide superior protection through:  
> - Secure enclave storage  
> - Anti-phishing protections  
> - Automatic key rotation
