# Ethereum vs Bitcoin SV: A Comprehensive Guide to Cryptocurrency Investment in 2025  

Cryptocurrency investment remains one of the most dynamic opportunities in modern finance. As blockchain technology evolves, digital assets like **Ethereum (ETH)** and **Bitcoin SV (BSV)** continue to attract attention from both seasoned investors and newcomers. This guide explores their core differences, market performance, and investment potential while highlighting practical strategies for portfolio diversification.  

## Key Differences Between Ethereum and Bitcoin SV  

Understanding the fundamental distinctions between these cryptocurrencies is crucial for informed decision-making. Letâ€™s examine their technical specifications and market metrics:  

### 1. **Supply Dynamics**  
- **Ethereum**: Unlike Bitcoinâ€™s capped supply, Ethereum employs a deflationary model through token burning. As of 2025, its circulating supply stands at approximately 120 million ETH, with no fixed maximum.  
- **Bitcoin SV**: A hard fork of Bitcoin Cash, BSV maintains a maximum supply of 21 million coins, mirroring Bitcoinâ€™s scarcity principle. Its circulating supply reached 19.8 million in 2025.  

### 2. **Market Activity**  
- **Trading Volume**: Ethereum dominates with a 24-hour trading volume exceeding $362 billion, reflecting its widespread adoption. Bitcoin SV trails significantly at $1.54 million, indicating lower liquidity.  
- **Price Volatility**: ETHâ€™s daily price fluctuation (-2.56%) suggests higher market sensitivity compared to BSVâ€™s (-1.85%), which signals relative stability.  

### 3. **Technological Purpose**  
- **Ethereum** focuses on smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps), powering over 60% of DeFi protocols.  
- **Bitcoin SV** emphasizes scalability for enterprise-level blockchain solutions, aiming to rival traditional payment systems.
