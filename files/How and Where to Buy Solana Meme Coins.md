### Setup Process

2. **Create Password**: Protect your wallet with a strong, unique password.  
3. **Backup Recovery Phrase**: Write down your 12-word recovery phrase and store it offline.  
4. **Acquire SOL Tokens**:  
   - Transfer SOL from centralized exchanges like Binance or Coinbase.  
   - Purchase SOL directly via MoonPay integration within Phantom (note higher fees for card payments).  

**Tip**: Maintain at least $5â€“$10 worth of SOL for transaction fees and initial purchases.

## Step 2: Choosing a Trading Platform

### **Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)**

DEXs like Raydium enable direct blockchain trading without intermediaries. This allows immediate participation in new meme coin launches, often hours before they appear on centralized platforms.

#### How to Buy on Raydium

1. Visit [Raydium.io](https://raydium.io/) and connect your Phantom wallet.  
2. Select "Swap" and enter the amount of SOL to trade.  
3. Confirm transaction details in your wallet.  

**Example**: Buying MEW tokens by swapping SOL takes 5â€“10 seconds with negligible fees.

#### Alternative DEXs

- **Jupiter**: Aggregates liquidity from multiple DEXs for optimal pricing.  
- **Orca**: Intuitive interface for beginners.  
- **Phoenix**: High-speed order execution for active traders.  

### **Centralized Exchanges (CEXs)**

CEXs like Binance and Coinbase are suitable for established meme coins (e.g., WIF, BONK) with high liquidity. However, they **rarely list new projects quickly**, limiting opportunities for early investors.
